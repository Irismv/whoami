            <h2>My programming experience</h2>
            <p>There is not much to tell you about my previous programming experience. I can however tell you about what
                i've learned so far, which is a lot.
                My first day at the IT study I didn't even know what basic programming was. After my first week at the
                IT study I learned how to make a website with multiple pages. This was a big step for me considering I
                knew nothing 7 days before. In my second week I learned what CSS is and how to use it. This was honestly
                the best but at the same time worst thing that I learned. It was awesome that I could finally make my
                website prettier, but learning about CSS opened up so many different possibilities that I kinda got
                overwhelmed.
                I still have mixed feelings about CSS, cause it caused a lot of problems in my code. It also solved a
                lot of problems, so thats something..
                I've noticed that you learn a lot in a short amount of time at this study. I honestly look forward to
                whatever i'm going to learn next.
