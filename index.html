                        <p>Why did I decide to go for the IT study at the HZ?
                            IT at the HZ wasn't really my first choice. I always liked playing videogames
                            and learning about computers, but I never really thought that my career would
                            have anything to do with those things. My first choice was to go to the police academy
                            and become a detective. Sadly that wasn't an option anymore,
                            because I had to get 2 surgeries in a short amount of time. So I had to start looking
                            for something else to do. An IT study still wasn't an option for me. I decided
                            that i'd really like to work in a hospital. I went to the view day at the HZ in Vlissingen
                            to see if the HZ was the right school for me. When I applied for the view day
                            I could pick another study to look there as well. I decided to look at the IT
                            study, because (like i mentioned before) I like videogames. I instantly liked
                            the IT study. I liked it so much that I didn't even go to the study I originally came for.
                            And here we are, a few months later and i'm on my way to become a IT professional.</p>

                <p> What is my future going to look like?
                    To be honest, I don't know..
                    I can however tell you how i'd like my future to look like.
                    After I finished the IT study I really want to either continue
                    studying at the uni and do something with cybersecurity or start
                    my own business. If i start my own business I want the focus
                    of my company to be about helping people in any way I can.
                    I don't need to get rich with my work (altough it would be a bonus)
                    as long as my work has helped a few people whilst still enjoying my work, then i'm happy!
