                    <b>IT choice</b>
                    <p>Why did I decide to go for the IT study at the HZ?
                        IT at the HZ wasn't really my first choice. I always liked playing videogames
                        and learning about computers, but I never really thought that my career would
                        have anything to do with those things. My first choice was to go to the police academy
                        and become a detective. Sadly that wasn't an option anymore,
                        because I had to get 2 surgeries in a short amount of time. So I had to start looking
                        for something else to do. An IT study still wasn't an option for me. I decided
                        that i'd really like to work in a hospital. I went to the view day at the HZ in Vlissingen
                        to see if the HZ was the right school for me. When I applied for the view day
                        I could pick another study to look there as well. I decided to look at the IT
                        study, because (like i mentioned before) I like videogames. I instantly liked
                        the IT study. I liked it so much that I didn't even go to the study I originally came for.
                        And here we are, a few months later and i'm on my way to become a IT professional.</p>

            <b>Future</b>
            <p> What is my future going to look like?
                To be honest, I don't know..
                I can however tell you how i'd like my future to look like.
                After I finished the IT study I really want to either continue
                studying at the uni and do something with cybersecurity or start
                my own business. If i start my own business I want the focus
                of my company to be about helping people in any way I can.
                I don't need to get rich with my work (altough it would be a bonus)
                as long as my work has helped a few people whilst still enjoying my work, then i'm happy!
