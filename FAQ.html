                    <p class="faq">There are two ways to print a document from your laptop. 
                        The first way is to go to <a href="https://mynetpay.nl/">mynetpay</a>
                        Find the Hz school and log in. Click on the option 'mobility print' and follow the further instructions.
                        The second way is a bit easier. Scan the QR-code in the printing room, click on 'mobility printing' and follow further instructions.

                <p class="faq">There's a very specific step-by-step plan on how to do this on the hz website.
                    I'm going to lead you to the step-by-step plan. Firstly you're going to go to the myhz site. You
                    need to log in to follow the rest of the instructions. If you have trouble signing in, you should
                    ask a teacher for help.
                    You should see a page with the 'Welcome back' text. Click on the 'Change my personal menu' button.
                    Find the 'Selfservice Portal' and add it to your home menu. Save the changes and head back to the
                    'Welcome back' page.
                    Click on the Selfservice Portal and press the 'reservation' button. You should be able to see a
                    stickman figure with a red background
                    with the text 'How do I make a reservation?'. Follow the instructions on that page and you should be
                    able to reserve a room!

                    You need it to print documents from your laptop, you can borrow books from the libary and you can
                    enter
                    the JRCZ ( If you completed the short trainingtest). You can only print documents if you have enough
                    balance on your card.
                    You can put more money on the card by using the ATM of the Hz. You'll find the ATM on the right side
                    of the receptiondesk.</p>
