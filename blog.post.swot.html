                <h2>Strengths</h2>
                <p>I think my biggest strength is my ability to work in groups. I like to work together with other
                    people and to take the lead to make sure that everything works out. I also feel like i'm good at
                    making sure everyone has the opportunity to express their opinion.
                </p>

                <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
                <p>One of my biggest areas for improvement is my planning skills. I tend to delay my work until the last
                    moment. This results in stressful moments that could've been avoided.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="swot-box">
                <h2>Opportunities</h2>
                <p>I see the opportunity to broaden my knowledge within the IT field. I hope that expanding my knowledge will eventually help me make a decision about which part of the IT field appeals to me the most.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="swot-box">
                <h2>Threats</h2>
                <p>I think my motivation can be a threat. I can be super enthusiastic about a project, but if i notice that my colleagues don't share the same enthousiasm as me then I tend to just stop working and let the project fail.
                    This is something I have to prevent from happening. </p>
