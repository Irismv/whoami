        <h2>Cybersecurity, why is it so important?</h2>
        <p> In the world we live in today, we use internet for almost everything.
            From shopping the latest items to social media and work. Because we use it so much, it's important to
            protect our information and devices from threats.
            <br> Cybersecurity means protecting our networks, data and devices against viruses or hackers. Protecting
            these things aren't easy. Common threats are phising, malware or data leaks. For businesses, a good and
            strong cybersecurity is important. If personal information about their customers leaks, it would damage the
            business's reputation and it might result in money loss. For us as individuals, a good cyber security is
            also very important. If we don't protect our information the right way, it could result in our bank details
            or passwords becoming public. Always try to make a strong password, keep your security software up-to-date
            and turn on two-factor authentication. Doing this lowers the risk of being a victim to cyber attacks. To
            summarize, make sure to have good cybersecurity
            to prevent the (sadly common) attacks.
