            <h2>My study choice</h2>
            <p>On my home page I already explained why I enrolled at this IT study. Here i'm going to explain why I
                decided to stay at this study so far.
                So, what do I like about IT? I really like the programming part about this study. I've always had an
                interest in how things work and with programming you can see exactly why something is or isn't working.
                I also like the designing side of the study. In school I used to draw a lot and I really enjoyed that,
                so its very fun to have that designing aspect here as well. I think the best part about this study is
                the fact that you can basically do anything. The possibilities are endless and I really like that. If
                you have a problem then there are multiple ways to solve it. I also really like the fact that the study
                just keeps developing itself. There are constantly new things to learn, so everyone just keeps on
                learning ( even the people with years and years of experience).
                To summarize: I like the fact that the study has so many different aspects where nothing is impossible and you're always expanding your knowledge
